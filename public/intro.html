      <p id="subtitle">REVENGE OF CODERS</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The FIRST ORDER reigns. Having decimated the peaceful Republic, Supreme Leader PLAYER 1
        now deploys the merciless legions to seize military control of the galaxy.
        <br>
        Only General PLAYER 2's band of RESISTANCE fighters stand against the rising tyranny,
        certain that Jedi Master CJ Hannah will return and restore a spark of code to the fight.
        <br>
        But the Resistance has been exposed.
        <br>
        Rebel spaceships, striking
        from a hidden base, have won
        their first victory against
        the evil Galactic Empire.
        <br>
        During the battle, Rebel
        spies managed to steal secret
        plans to the Empire's
        ultimate weapon, the DEATH
        STAR, an armored space
        station with enough power to
        destroy an entire planet.
        <br>
        Pursued by the Empire's
        sinister agents, PLAYER 2
        races home aboard her
        starship, custodian of the
        stolen plans that can save
        her people and restore
        freedom to the galaxy.....
